- 👋 Hi, I’m @jamesmadelin
- 👀 I’m interested in a lot of things... principally finding business development roles in tech companies worldwide remote or Geneva/Lausanne/Fribourg, and algorithmic derivatives trading.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to improve my EasyLanguage (Tradestation and MultiCharts) coding, algo robustness and provisioning AWS for a trading VM.
- 💞️ Please get in touch if you're based in Geneva, Lausanne or Suisse Romande with similar expertise.
